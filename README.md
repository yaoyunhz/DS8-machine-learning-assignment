Human Activity Recognition (HAR) has received increasing attention in the computing research community in the recent years. Wearable HAR devices and fitness trackers such as FitBit make it easy to collect a large amount of data about personal activities relatively inexpensively. The potential applications for such data include elderly monitoring, energy expenditure monitoring, and weight-loss assistance. 

HAR research has been focused on discriminating between different activities rather than how well an activity is performed. Similarly, users of wearable HAR devices can easily quantify how much a particular activity they do, but cannot quantify how well they do it. This project uses data from accelerometers on the belt, forearm, arm, and dumbbell to identify correct and incorrect weight lifting methods. By developing a machine learning algorithm to distinguish correct and incorrect methods for exercising, the project can provide useful information for a large variety of applications, such as avoiding injuries, providing self-guided physical therapy, and increasing the efficiency of sports training.

The dataset for this project comes from http://groupware.les.inf.puc-rio.br/har
